# Android_Arduino_Tensorflow-MIDI2CV
This project starts for Master Degree first year's project. This is a Android application to control a analogic modular synthesizer. I tried also to generate some music with a deep learning model. This is not finish.
I used the TensorFlow model from Thibault Neveu : https://github.com/thibo73800/tensorflow2.0-examples/blob/master/RNN%20-%20Text%20Generator.ipynb.
I also used the librairy USBSerial from felHR85 : https://github.com/felHR85/UsbSerial.
